 freepn-gtk3-tray - fpnd control/status GUI
============================================

This is currently a (barely) working skeleton for a tray contoller GUI to go
with the `freepn/fpnd`_ daemon.  It depends on PyGobject and GTK+3 and the
associated gobject libraries.  The hackiest bit is probably the ``setup.cfg``
bits for making setuptools install the icons/desktop file somewhere besides
the egg.
